## About

A centralized competition registration platform where all drone racing pilots can register for competitions.

## Development - Get started
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (and docker-compose v2.x)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- [Nginx proxy manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com) (optional)

You can start developing in 2 ways:
### Devcontainers

1. Clone the repository
2. Reopen in container
3. When the container build is finished: `bash init.sh`

### Docker

How to start with this Laravel Docker template:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file and make an symbolic link

```bash
cp ./laravel/.env.example ./laravel/.env
ln -s laravel/.env .env
```

3. Inside the `.env` file give the following variables a value
    - `APP_NAME`
    - `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`
    - `DB_HOST`
    - `DB_DATABASE`
    - `DB_USERNAME`
    - `DB_PASSWORD`
    - `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`

4. Change the port numbers according to your situation
    - `DB_PORT`
    - `HOST_HTTP_PORT`
    - `HOST_HTTPS_PORT`

> NOTE: if you are going to use your Laravel environment in combination with a domain name and SSL, change the `APP_ENV` to **production**.

5. Install the composer packages and generate a key

```bash
cd laravel && composer install && php artisan key:generate && cd ..
```

6. Create an symbolic link to for the storage folder
```bash
cd laracel && php artisan storage:link && cd ..
```

## Run

When you have done the getting started part, it's time to start the docker containers.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

After this only do a Laravel migration to the database and you are ready!

```bash
cd laravel && php artisan migrate
```
</details>

## Tools

### Create storage symlink

When you create a symlink according to the laravel command (`php artisan storage:link`) it will create a static link and
cause problems in the docker container. It's best to run the following command to get the same result:

```bash
cd public && ln -s ../storage/app/public storage
```

### Create a backup

To make a backup of the application, run the command below.

```bash
php artisan backup:run
```
